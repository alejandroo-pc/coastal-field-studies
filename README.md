## About The Project

This log-book contains my observations during my participation in Coastal Field Studies(ENVS-189) led by Rachel Lazzeri-Aerts at San Jose State University.

I documneted various aspects of the coastal environments we studied, including geological features, habitats, species, and human influences. Each entry provides detailed notes on specific locations, complemented by images from each field trip.
