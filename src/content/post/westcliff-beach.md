## West Cliff Beach

### Human Influences

**Coastal Armoring**

- Sea walls to protect the face of the coast
- Riprap (rocks) is commonly used along the coastline
- Soft armoring: restoring dunes, coral, utilizing restoration (natural) instead of man-made
- Sea walls only work where they are constructed
- Winter of 1975 - 2008:
  - 8 major storms
  - 33 houses destroyed
  - 33,000 houses damaged

**Downsides of armoring**

- Expensive and can decrease housing value
- Lack of proper surveying for permits, often done as last-minute damage/preparation, potentially harming local wildlife
- Coastal commission may stop permits for riprap
- Public will always have access to the beach, but riprap limits access
- Only works where it's placed, can redired the problem to another cliff, beach, or house
- Waves can get pushed up and over into streets/houses

## Seabright Beach / Castle Beach

### Habitats and Species

**Plants**

- Restoration site in progress
- Sagebrush
- Yarrow
- Coyote brush

### Human Influences

**History**

- Used to be a narrow beach
- Bathhouse demolished in the 1960sand

**Legacy Impacts**

- Jetty with lighthouse protecting Santa Cruz harbor
- Jetty collected sand, making the beach wider over time
- Littoral drift transported sand to the south, leading to sand accumulation in the harbor
- Beaches south of the harbor became narrower
- Beach nourishment required due to low sand levels
- Sand mining for cement (last beach mine closed in 2020)
