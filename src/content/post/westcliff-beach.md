## West cliff Beach

## Coastal Armoring

- sea walls to protect the face of the coast
- Riprap is a common rock along coastline
- Soft armoring: restoring dunes, coral, utilizing restoration (natural) instead of man made
- Sea wall:
- Only works where you PUT IT

## Downsize of armoring

- economics, expensive and housing value goes down.
- Not enough survey for permits sometimes. Often done during last min damage/prep. This may harm local wildlife
- Coastal commission to stop permits for riprap
- Public access: the public will always have access to beach, but riprap limits access
- Only works where you out it, pushes the problem to another cliff, beach, house.
  - Waves get pushed up and over into street/houses

## Managed Retreat

- We can’t armor anymore…what do we do now? (Adaptation strategy)

## History

- Cliff house: two types of armoring
  - Riprap
  - Gabions: smaller rock inside a wire cage. Used in place for large rocks
  - Provide stability and control
- Construction during 1960s/1970s
  - Some El Niño years
  - Then a calm pattern, no rainfall, no storms
  - 35/40 year period, we started building here and settling down
- Winter 75 - 2008
  - 8 major storms, 33 houses destroyed and 33,000 damaged
  - More storms, wave energy, intense storms = more erosion
- 1965 riprap started being put up

San Lorenzo Point

- Compressed rock made it more erosion resistant
