## Geological Features

**Hole In The Wall Beach**

- First and second marine terrace (~200,000 years old)
- Monterey sandstone: sedimentary, orange from oxidized iron, black/gray from midmen (oil)
- Santa Margarita sandstone: tan beige, pressure-formed dikes and sills
- Santa Cruz mudstone: ancient ocean sediments, high silica content
- Erosion created a arch connecting Panther Beach Hole In the Wall Beach
- Fossilized remains of marine life within the sedimentary layers

## Habitats and Species

**Species**

- Coastal plants (weeds currently, with blooms expected soon)
- Marine snails (operculum)
- Burrowing species like beach hoppers and sand crabs
- Seasonal migrations of whales and dolphins visible from the shoreline

## Human Influences

**Impacts**

- Incomplete railroad project
- Initial plans to stretch to San Fransico were abandoned
- Railroad gap from San Mateo to Davenport
- Parking lot was built to provide recreational access
- Development of hiking trails and viewing platforms altering access patterns and wildlife behavior

**Legacy Impacts**

- Railroad trusses and redirected Yellow Bank Creek
  - dynamite used to redirect creek for railroad project
  - altered natural creek path, preventing lake and marsh formation
- Introduction of non-native plant species disrupting the native ecosystem (ice plant)
