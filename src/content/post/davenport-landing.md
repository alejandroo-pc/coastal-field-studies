## History

- Establishment of Davenport Post Office in 1874, solidifying the area's identity
- Abandonment of Davenport's wharf in 1880 due to economic challenges
- Construction of a cement plant between 1905 and 1907, accompanied by the development of a small settlement named San Vicente to accommodate workers
- Destruction of Davenport Landing by fire in 1915, leading to its eventual disappearance from the local landscape
  - The town is small, but loved by the Santa Cruz / Bay Area Community
  - Preservation of coastal heritage through landmarks and local stories

## Geological Features

- Absence of remnants of the once-existing wharf, likely eroded due to wave action and lack of maintenance
